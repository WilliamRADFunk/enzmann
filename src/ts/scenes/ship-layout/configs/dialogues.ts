 for the crew. The mess<br>
 hall is where they eat<br>
 and socialize.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Improved equipment will<br>

 is also better for<br>
 morale."`,

    'Crew Quarters A': `"Crew quarters are<br>
 where your crew will<br>
 sleep and relax.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Larger crew quarters<br>

 your research and<br>
 improvements take place.<br>

 immersive experience."`,

 delicate cargo is stored.<br>
 Temperature, humidity,<br>
