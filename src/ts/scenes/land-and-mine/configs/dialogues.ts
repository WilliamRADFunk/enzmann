    'Fuel': `<br><br>
"The Fuel Gauge...<br><br>
Using your thrusters burns fuel.<br><br>
Improved engineering can reduce the rate of fuel burned."`,

    'Fuel2': `<br><br>
"...the readout's color will change when you drop below a dangerous threshold."`,

    'Fuel3': `<br><br>
"...when the gauge shows 0% you will drop from the sky and likely crash.<br><br>
You will lose the lander, the mining crew, and any materials collected."`,

    'Oxygen': `<br><br>
"The Oxygen Gauge...<br><br>
Your miners need air, and so they will consume oxygen inside or outside of the ship.<br><br>
Improved engineering can reduce the rate of oxygen consumed."`,

    'Oxygen2': `<br><br>
"...the readout's color will change when you drop below a dangerous threshold."`,

    'Oxygen3': `<br><br>
"...when the gauge shows 0% your mining crew will die, and the ship will return on autopilot.<br><br>
Only the materials loaded onto the lander will be brought back. Material carried by miners will be lost."`,

    'Ore': `<br><br>
"This is the block type representing 'ore' found on this planetoid.<br><br>
The amount they represent varies based on quantity readout."`,

    'Common': `<br><br>
"These are the block types commonly found on this planetoid.<br><br>
They are of no value, but can be drilled through without trouble."`,

    'Water': `<br><br>
"These are the block types representing water found on this planetoid. Collecting them earns you water.<br><br>
Block on the left is liquid water. Block on the right is ice."`,

    'Plant': `<br><br>
"These are the block types representing plants found on this planetoid. Collecting them earns you food.<br><br>
The amount they represent varies based on quantity readout."`,

    'Danger': `<br><br>
"This is the block type representing dangerous or impenetrable substances.<br><br>
Your drill can't pass here."`,

    'Wind': `<br><br>
"Some planetoids have atmosphere, and sometimes that means wind.<br><br>
Find the wind readout at the top of the game screen to know the wind speed."`,

    'Wind2': `<br><br>
"The numerical value will, be accompanied by an arrow to denote direction.<br><br>
Also, there may be debris blowing about, which should demonstrate wind direciton."`,

    'Wind3': `<br><br>
"Thrusting in the same direction as wind will increase your speed.<br><br>
Thrusting against wind, will thwart your progress.<br><br>
Without thrusting, the wind will at most null your speed."`,
